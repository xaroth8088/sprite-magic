sprite-magic
============
A tool for making and sharing game-ready spritesheets.  Comes with a library of free sprites!

This project is in its infancy, but there's now something to tinker with if you're a developer.  The project currently requires Python 2.7 and the PIL installed to run.  New features, bugfixes, documentation, and art + spec contributions are welcome!

If you're just looking to get down to business and have an easy-to-use program, be sure to check back later once the dust has settled a bit.

What is this?
-------------
Sprite Magic has two purposes:
* To provide a tool which can bridge the gap between paperdoll-style artwork and game-ready spritesheets.
* To provide a library of free (libre) artwork which can be used in a game.

As a bonus, Sprite Magic can easily be used by artists to help preview animations when creating sprites.
