sprite-magic
============
A tool for making and sharing game-ready spritesheets.  Comes with a library of free sprites!

_This project is in its infancy, and has nothing to actually play with yet.  Please check back later!_

What is this?
-------------
Sprite Magic has two purposes:
* To provide a tool which can bridge the gap between paperdoll-style artwork and game-ready spritesheets.
* To provide a library of free (libre) artwork which can be used in a game.

As a bonus, Sprite Magic can easily be used by artists to help preview animations when creating sprites.

How can I contribute?
-------------
Sprite Magic needs your art!  Instructions for how to contribute will come soon, after some of the basics of the program are in place.  We'll need the art in .png format with a transparent background, and a specially-formatted file to let the program know which frames go where.

A word about licensing...
-------------
The GPLv3 only applies to the code for this project itself.  Free artwork provided on this project has a variety of licenses and attribution requirements, including: CC0 public domain, GPL, Creative Commons, and others.  Please check the individual art directories for licensing and attribution.
