* A wizard to help create .spec files
* Unit tests
* Proper logging
* Validation for edge cases (missing / bad .spec files, missing directories, etc.)
* Permit spec files to refer to images inside of subdirectories in a platform-independent way (use '/'s for path separator, then regex them out for os.sep)
* Permit sheet spec files to include an offset into the image for the grid
* Permit sheet spec files to include absolute image coordinates, instead of the implied grid
* Organize the licensing information more logically
* Give a button to copy the licensing information to clipboard (with a confirmation dialog upon clicking, so they know it's in the buffer)
