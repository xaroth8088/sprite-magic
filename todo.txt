* Export sheets in a variety of ways
* A wizard to help create .spec files
* Unit tests
* Proper logging
* Validation for edge cases (missing / bad .spec files, missing directories, etc.)
* Permit spec files to exist in subdirectories
* Permit sheet spec files to include an offset into the image for the grid
* Permit sheet spec files to include absolute image coordinates, instead of the implied grid
* Organize the licensing information more logically
* Give a button to copy the licensing information to clipboard (with a confirmation dialog upon clicking, so they know it's in the buffer)
* Horizontal scrolling for preview
* Find a better GUI toolkit than tkinter, because this is causing a lot of problems with really basic things like scrolling frames, fluid layouts, native widgets, etc.
